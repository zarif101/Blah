## Overview

**Blah** is an AI assistant designed to make phone calls on your behalf to people or places and report back with the information you need, so you donâ€™t have to. The assistant takes the form of a simple Flask app.

## Features

- **Automated Calls**: Blah can automatically call individuals or businesses and gather information for you.
- **AI-Powered**: Uses advanced AI technologies to understand and interact during calls.
- **Call Logs**: All call logs are stored in the "history" folder. A simple example is currently available in the repository.
  
## Tech Stack

- **OpenAI**: For natural language understanding and generation.
- **Twilio**: To handle the call functionality.
- **Whisper**: For voice recognition and transcription.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building the application interface.

Instructions on how to install and run the application will be provided in the upcoming updates.
